                <h2>Hi, I'm Eric Nielsen ðŸ‘‹</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a fifth-year Computer Information Systems student at Mount Royal University, focusing on developing rich web applications and exploring data analysis. Currently, I'm refining my web development skills, especially with frameworks like React.

                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    My fascination with technology started early on, driven by a curiosity for the mechanics behind my favorite video games, like Minecraft and Mario Kart Wii. The ability to control pixels on a screen seemed magical, sparking a passion that led me to experiment with coding in high school. I created physics formula calculators in C++ (not perfect, but a start!) and even built my own PC.

                <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active through weight training and long walks with my dog. I also love reading and writing about philosophy and human biology, especially topics around the endocrine system.

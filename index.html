            <p>
                Hello there! 
                My name is Eric Nielsen, and I am currently a second year Computer Information Systems
                student at <a href="https://www.mtroyal.ca/"> Mount Royal University</a>. My areas of study include 
                Object Oriented Programming in Java, relational databases with SQL, web design, and business fundamentals. </p>
            <p> In terms of programming tastes, I have a particular interest in data analysis, and web development. Robotics is an area that interests me, and that I'd like to explore in the future.</p>
            
            <p> With all of that said, I'm glad you're here! Don't 
            be shy, look around!</p>

Whether it be multi-year commitment to the gym, going at least 4 times a week, my love for running (shocking I know), my consistent training of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, or even just the hikes that I do in the rockies, fitness is an integral part of my life. On any given day, you're likely to find me at your local gym's squat rack, on the roads running away, or at the BJJ mats getting the air choked out of me.

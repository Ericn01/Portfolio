                <h1>Eric Nielsen</h1>
                <p class="lead">I'm fascinated by what happens when you ask the right questions about data and pursue the answers rigorously. I work in Python for statistical analysis and machine learning, and I'm particularly drawn to problems involving human systems. That includes biology, neuroscience, pharmacology, and health outcomes. I'm still building my skills, but what drives me is genuine curiosity about what statistical methods can reveal.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Experience</h2>
                <h3>Alberta Health Services - Data Analyst Intern</h3>
                <p>During my internship at AHS, I worked primarily with Power BI and SQL Server Management Studio on healthcare data projects. Most of my time went into building a project management dashboard in Power BI, connected to Excel data sources, that tracked ongoing and expected projects including resource allocation, scope, and timelines.</p>
                <p>This experience taught me practical skills I hadn't learned in coursework: how to present data effectively to stakeholders, the importance of clear and consistent communication with the people who'll actually use what you build, and the fundamentals of ETL processes in a real-world enterprise environment. Working with healthcare data also meant understanding the importance of data accuracy and attention to detail when the stakes are high.</p>

                <h3>Mount Royal University - Bachelor of Computer Information Systems</h3>
                <p><em>Fall 2020 - Winter 2024</em></p>
                <p>This program gave me a strong foundation in both technical skills and business understanding. I built capabilities in software development, systems analysis, and project management through hands-on coursework in web development, databases, and applied machine learning. The degree prepared me to work at the intersection of technology and business in the digital economy.</p>
                <p><strong>Relevant Coursework:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Linear Algebra for Data Science:</strong> Learned powerful linear algebra methods including singular value decomposition, principal component analysis, linear regression, the importance of orthogonality of vectors, and Haar transforms.</p>
                <p><strong>Applied Machine Learning:</strong> Studied machine learning algorithms for both supervised and unsupervised methods (classification, clustering), euclidean distance, the application of various models, and the general process for building models using scikit-learn.</p>
                <p><strong>Programming Courses (Programming 1-3):</strong> Learned to program in Java, JavaScript, PHP, and Python. Covered general software development principles, object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms.</p>
                <p><strong>Database Courses (Database I/II):</strong> Learned to write complex SQL queries, database normalization, database design, and data mining.</p>
